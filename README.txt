Use of these programs will allow you to draw a matrix in python and the matrix of the Arduino R4 Uno w/LED Matrix will update.  Designed to be used for drawing test patterns in real-time.

In the python program:
SPACEBAR will output a 3 hex code for the current matrix on the arduino
'R' key will reset all LEDs in the matrix to the off state
'F' will turn on all LEDs in the matrix
